					<h5>North Kincardine Public Art Group</h5>
					<p class="left-align light">A group of local residents has come together as the North Kincardine Public Art Group to create a treasure map of North Kincardine. This is not buried treasure, but the different treasures within the landscape: its rich cultural history, stunning views and the little known gems in the countryside. The map, which covers the area from Torry to Stonehaven and from the sea to Maryculter, will show selected footpaths and cycle routes that will guide you through the treasures in our local landscape. Each walk has different themes to explore and to learn about. Some walks are fairly short, while others are quite long.</p>
